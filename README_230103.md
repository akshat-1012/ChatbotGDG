The script is designed to scrape problem details (problem statement, editorial, and metadata) from Codeforces problem pages or contests, saving the data into text and JSON files.
It begins by creating the necessary directories for storing problem statements, editorials, and metadata. When a contest link is provided, the script extracts links to all the problems within that contest. For each problem, it retrieves the problem title, statement, time and memory limits, problem ID (e.g., 'A' or 'B'), input/output specifications, test cases, tags, and difficulty level. To avoid duplicate content caused by HTML elements (e.g., math terms appearing twice), the code removes them using span.decompose().
For editorial extraction, the script first identifies the link to the editorial page, filtering out video tutorials and non-English content. It then searches the editorial for solutions related to the specific problem by matching the problem titles. The relevant editorial content (including hints, solutions, and code) is then extracted and saved to a file. Again, duplicate math terms are removed using span.decompose(), and unnecessary author names or solution credits are skipped.
This approach ensures clean, structured extraction of problem details and editorial content, even with multiple formats or languages involved.
